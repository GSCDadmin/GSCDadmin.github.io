          <h3 class="lead">Looking for motivated GPs to work in a supportive, state of the art practice delivering outstanding care to patients</h3>

          <p><b>We are looking for general practitioners to join our brand new medical centre located in Australia's newest and most dense development area of Green Square in Sydney, providing the highest quality medical care to a rapidly growing and diverse demographic.</b></p>

          <p><b>We are a privately owned practice, not a corporate, so patient care and an excellent work culture always comes first.</b></p>

          <hr>

          <p>Our purpose-built clinic is state-of-the-art; designed with modern architectural concepts for a safe, functional and effective work environment.</p>

          <p>We want to emphasise how important a collegiate team ethos with excellent clinical and teaching support is to us. Our practice principal and co-owner Dr Shane Christensen is a lecturer at Sydney University Medical School, as well as educator for GP supervisors with GP Synergy.</p>

          <p>At Green Square Health we are also committed to the highest standards of professional development including the enthusiastic teaching and training of medical students and junior doctors. We understand that as teachers we also learn from our students and our patients.</p>

          <p>The primary focus at Green Square Health is that of “preventative healthcare” and this mission statement is held close to heart by all our practitioners.</p>


          <hr>


          <p class="text-lg">We are currently looking for both part-time and full-time general practitioners who satisfy the following criteria:</p>


          <p><i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Experience in clinical general practice<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Exceptional communication skills<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Willingness to participate in ongoing education and development<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Have a collegiate nature<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Full work rights in Australia<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Vocational registration in Australia (RACGP/ACRRM)<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> Medical registration with AHPRA and professional indemnity cover<br>
             <i class="fa fa-check checked"></i> We are not in a DWS area and cannot cater for doctors with a 10 year moratorium</p>


          <p>This is the perfect opportunity for a clinician wanting to mould their own clinical practice. We particularly value practitioners who are keen to teach and have a passion for education.</p>

          <h4 class="kist-header">Our Demographic:</h4>
          <p>Those familiar with the Green Square area will know how quickly this precinct is growing. City of Sydney estimates that when the entire development is completed in 2030 the population will be 61000, from 13,295 in 2011. It is also an area of diversity and dichotomies in what the population data reveals. We hope the new Local Area Health profile due Q1 2016 will give us updated information, as will the 2016 census.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Current population is 22897 in Waterloo, Alexandria, Zetland combined</li>
          <li>10,000 new apartments in construction at present, 30,000 due by 2030</li>
          <li>A very young demographic, with young growing families, 47% of the population is aged 20-34</li>
          <li>However significant growth of the 65+ age group expected between 2011-2025</li>
          <li>Low unemployment rates with higher than NSW average income</li>
          <li>High homelessness rate (9.8/1000 population vs NSW avg 3.4/1000)</li>
          </ul>
